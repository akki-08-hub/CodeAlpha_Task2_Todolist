This code creates a simple To-Do List app that allows users to add, delete, and complete tasks.

Here's how it works:

1. The HTML file creates a basic structure for the app, including an input field for adding tasks, a button for adding tasks, and an unordered list for displaying tasks.
2. The CSS file styles the app, including the input field, button, and task list.
3. The JavaScript file uses the DOM to interact with the HTML elements and create the app's functionality.
4. When the user clicks the "Add Task" button, the addTask function is called, which creates a new task object and adds it to the tasks array.
5. The renderTaskList function is called, which creates an HTML string for the task list and updates the taskList element with the new HTML.
6. When the user clicks a task's "Delete" button, the deleteTask function is called, which removes the task from the tasks array and updates the task list.
7. When the user clicks a task's "Complete" button, the completeTask function is called, which toggles the task's completed property and updates the task
